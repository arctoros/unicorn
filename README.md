# unicorn

This is a 16-bit computer I designed and build in the game/simulator Turing Complete.  

I also added various modules, file a file reader, some more memory, and displays of various resolutions.  

The projects I coded for it:  
- I adapted my assembly code of Conway's game of Life from Pixie to run on this significantly larger display.  
- I let it render pictures converted to a binary file externally  
- I made a custom 5x3 font and made it render it to display some text  

I've included the game files for Turing Complete and the verilog export files for anyone wanting to dig deeper.  

The Font.md.excalidraw contains the custon 5x3 and the Excel file contains the architecture of unicorn.
